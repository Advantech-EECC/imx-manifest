i.MX Repo Manifest README

This repo is used to download manifests for i.MX BSP releases.

Specific instructions will reside in READMEs in each branch.

The branch will be based on the release type Linux or Android with release manifests in each branch tied to the base releases.

For example for i.MX Linux Yocto Project releases the branches will be imx_linux_<Yocto Project release> so imx_linux_thud with
all manifests tied to releases on Thud in this branch.
