i.MX Android BSP Repo Manifest README

This repo is used to download manifests for i.MX Android BSP releases.

The imx-android-oreo branch will include all release manifests for Android i.MX Oreo releases.
The code is not distributed as patches as previous i.MX Android releases.
Instead the i.MX Android open source is distributed on the https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx
and the proprietary is distributed on nxp.com.   Please download from nxp.com first the proprietary
release and follow the README directions for configuring.  Below are directions for preparation.

To use this manifest repo, the 'repo' tool must be isntalled first.

- Set up the environment for building. This only configures the current terminal.
$ source build/envsetup.sh

- Execute the Android lunch command.
lunch command can be issued with an argument <Build name>-<Build type> or can be issued without the argument presenting a menu of selection.
$ lunch <Build name>-<Build type>

Check Android User's Guide for more details

- Execute the make command to generate the image.
$ make 2>&1 | tee build-log.txt
